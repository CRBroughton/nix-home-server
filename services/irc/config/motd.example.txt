                     Welcome to LocalIRC
================================================================================

This is a private IRC server. New to IRC? Here's what you need to know:

GETTING STARTED
  Your account was created by an admin. Log in using SASL authentication
  in your IRC client with the credentials you were given.

  Once connected:
  1. Join a channel: /join #general
  2. Send a message - just type and press Enter!

STAY CONNECTED (even when offline)
  Enable always-on mode to receive messages while you're away:
     /msg NickServ SET ALWAYS-ON true

  When you reconnect, you'll see any messages you missed!

COMMON COMMANDS
  /join #channel      Join a chat room
  /part #channel      Leave a chat room
  /msg nick message   Send a private message
  /me action          Show an action (e.g., /me waves)
  /nick newnick       Change your display name
  /quit               Disconnect

WHAT YOU'LL SEE
  After connecting, you may see "User mode is +Z" - this just means
  your connection is encrypted (secure). Nothing to worry about!

  Usernames with @ are channel operators (moderators).
  Usernames with + have voice (can speak in moderated channels).

NEED HELP?
  /msg NickServ HELP    Account help
  /msg ChanServ HELP    Channel help
